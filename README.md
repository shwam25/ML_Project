Objective: 
----------------

(a) Analyse ice-cream consumption and daily revenue in dollars based on the temperature.

(b) Create a model that could predict the ice-cream daily revenue in dollars based on the temperature.

Technologies
---------------
Python Pandas 

Python Matplotlib

Machine Learning Model - Random Forest Regression

Deep Learning Model - Neural Networks (Keras) Regression


Summary
-------------
1.Models - Neural Network (Keras) Regression provides predictive model with greater accuracy.

2.Revenue and Temperature: As per our graphs, Revenue and Temperature are very strongly positive correlated.

3.Temperature and Consumption: 

(a)Summer months [June - August] - Highest Consumption

(b)Winter months [December - February] - Lowest Consumption
